### What I learned

The tag structure of the Navigation Mobile component is as follows

```html
  <div class="nav__mobile">
    <img
      class="icon-close"
      src="./assets/images/icon-menu-close.svg"
      alt="icon-close"
    >
    <div class="nav__column">
      <ul class="menu">
        <li class="menu__item">
          <a class="menu__link" href="#">Home</a>
        </li>
        <li class="menu__item">
          <a class="menu__link" href="#">New</a>
        </li>
        <li class="menu__item">
          <a class="menu__link" href="#">Popular</a>
        </li>
        <li class="menu__item">
          <a class="menu__link" href="#">Trending</a>
        </li>
        <li class="menu__item">
          <a class="menu__link" href="#">Categories</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
```

Here we can see the styles that are added to show and hide navigation on mobile devices.

```css
.nav__mobile {
  opacity: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: var(--very-dark-blue-transparency);
  z-index: 2;
  transition: opacity 0.6s ease-out;
}
.nav__mobile--visible {
  opacity: 1;
  pointer-events: auto;
}
```

When we click on the menu icon we add the appropriate class to make visible the navigation links that were hidden and click on the close icon to hide the navigation again.

```js
  const iconMenu = document.querySelector(".menu-icon"),
  iconClose = document.querySelector(".icon-close"),
  navMobile = document.querySelector(".nav__mobile");

iconMenu.addEventListener("click", () => {
  navMobile.classList.add("nav__mobile--visible");
});

iconClose.addEventListener("click", () => {
  navMobile.classList.remove("nav__mobile--visible");
});

```

### Continued development

Maybe I would need to improve the handling of grid in CSS and be able to make spacings of text and sections a little more precise and consistent. But in general I had a lot of fun doing this challenge because I could reinforce CSS grid and combine with flexbox.tambi√©n using the opacity property instead of the none value of the display property to hide the mobile navigation, as it is an animatable (that can be animated) property allowed me to use transitions.
